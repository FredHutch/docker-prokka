# docker-prokka
Lightweight Docker image running Prokka

Based on ummidock/prokka from [https://github.com/B-UMMI/docker-images](https://github.com/B-UMMI/docker-images), this is a very light layer on top that merely adds a wrapper to make it easier to run as a command within a larger sciluigi workflow.
